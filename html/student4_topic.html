            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Sinharaja Rain Forest, situated in the south-west lowland wet zone of Sri Lanka, 
                is a vital biodiversity hotspot covering 11,000 hectares of primary and secondary forests. 
                It comprises rolling ridges and valleys, with over 60% of its trees being endemic and many considered rare. 
                The forest teems with endemic wildlife, particularly birds, butterflies, mammals, insects, reptiles, and rare amphibians. 
                Recognizing its significance, UNESCO declared Sinharaja Forest a World Heritage site in 1988. 
                As the country's last viable primary tropical rainforest, it holds immense ecological importance and was first acknowledged as such in 1936.

            <h2>Climate</h2>
            <p>
                The average annual temperature of Sinharaja is approximately 23. 6°C. 
                It annually receives more than 2500mm of rainfall and lies within 38 10-5080mm isohyets. 
                The rainfall is well distributed with peak periods, during the two monsoons, May – July and October – December. 
                There is no dry spell throughout the year.

            <h2>Plant Life</h2>
            <p>
                Sinharaja Forest in Sri Lanka is a remarkable Tropical Lowland Rain Forest or Tropical Wet Evergreen Forest with dominant trees towering between 35m to 50m in height. 
                The diversity of species is impressive, but dense undergrowth is rare, though seen in rock shelves and canopy gaps. 
                Endemism is high, notably in families like Dipterocarpaceae, with 66% of identified woody trees and lianas being endemic. 
                Even lower plants like ferns and epiphytes show significant endemism. The total vegetation density is approximately 240,000 individuals per hectare, 
                primarily comprising ground-layer individuals below 1m height. Tree density ranges from 600-700 individuals/ha for lianas above 30cm girth, 
                while merchantable trees over 150cm girth range between 45-55 individuals/ha.

            <h2>Animal Life</h2>
            <p>
                Sinharaja Forest hosts a diverse and endemic-rich fauna, with high endemism among butterflies, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. 
                It is a vital habitat for 95% of Sri Lanka's endemic bird species. While elephant sightings have declined, leopards leave signs of their presence. 
                The Purple-faced Leaf Monkey is a commonly seen primate, and mixed bird flocks include 12 endemic species among 48 observed. 
                Agamids dominate reptiles, with the rare Calotes liolipis, and several endemic amphibians are found, including Ramanella palmata and yellow-banded Caecilian. 
                The Green Pit Viper and Hump-nosed Viper are common endemic snakes.
