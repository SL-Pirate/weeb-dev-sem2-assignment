                    Sigiriya Lion Rock is an ancient rock fortress known for its massive column of rock that reaches nearly 200 meters high.
                     The site dates back to the reign of King Kasyapa (477-495 AD), who chose this site as his new capital. He decorated the walls with frescoes, and built an impressive palace right on top of the rock column,
                      accessible only through the mouth of an enormous carved lion.

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p class="block">
                    Sigiriya was built by the fifth-century king Kashyapa I, who ruled the native Sinhalese dynasty, the Moriya. 
                    The imposing fortress was the capital of the Sinhalese kingdom until Kashyapa was defeated in A.D. 495.
                    After Kashyapa, dynasties rose and fell, their fortunes shaped by internal power struggles and conflicts
                    between native Sinhalese and outside invaders from India.
                    </p>
                    <p class="block" >
                    The fortress was later swallowed by the forest, and only familiar to local villagers. Outsiders used knowledge of its past,
                     preserved in Buddhist texts, to search for the ancient site. British historians rediscovered its astonishing buildings and 
                     frescoes in the 19th century.

                    Sigiriya consists of an ancient citadel built by King Kashyapa during the 5th century. The Sigiriya site contains the ruins of an upper palace 
                    located on the flat top of the rock, a mid-level terrace that includes the Lion Gate and the mirror wall with its frescoes, the lower palaces clings to the 
                    slopes below the rocks. The moats, walls and gardens of the palace extended for a few hundred metres from the base of the rock. The site was both a palace and a fortress. 
                    The upper palace on the top of the rock includes cisterns cut into the rock.

                    <h3>1.Sigiriya Mirror Wall</h3>
                    <p>Just past the "Sigiriya Frescoes", you walk alongside what is known as the “Mirror Wall” — a wall polished so heavily that the king would have been able to see his reflection 
                    on the surface. You’ll see names and notes scribbled into the wall, some from as early as the 8th century, by visitors to Sigiriya Lions Rock.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. Sigiriya Lion's Paw</h3>
                    <p>At the northern end of the Sigiriya Lion Rock, a narrow pathway emerges on to the large platform from which the site derives its name – Sigiriya (from sinha-giri) means 'Lions Rock'. 
                    HCP Bell, the British archaeologist responsible for an enormous amount of archaeology in Sri Lanka, found the two enormous lion paws when excavating in 1898.
                   The final ascent to the top commenced with a stairway that led between the Sigiriya lion’s paws and into its mouth.
